## Integration and Pathways to Belonging: Exploring How Location Matters for Refugee Resettlement in the U.S.

### Overview
Human migration is a common, yet often controversial phenomenon. Even when a newcomers' legal status is not a point of contention, their presence can challenge a range of views on identity, place, and belonging. America has been described as a cultural "melting pot", but what exactly does this mean? And how do we meaningfully examine how individuals and communities experience, promote, and challenge this "melting" as it happens? Countless books, documentaries, and dissertations have not exhausted all that there is to explore on this topic. Therefore, it is unlikely that a single shiny app can do it justice either. What this app can do, however, is function as a resource for others who care about these types of questions. 

### Research Questions
This project reflects one starting point for understanding this phenomenon. I focus on the experiences of a specific group of newcomers, refugee arrivals, to explore two general questions:    
  
_1. What are the origins of people who are admitted to the U.S. as refugees?_    
This directs our attention to data on who is entering the melting pot, so to speak. Why refugees, you ask? I zero in on refugees because U.S. federal policies, funds, and programs evidence a desire to help this population. For FY 2021, the federal government budgeted a minimum of <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/report-to-congress-on-proposed-refugee-admissions-for-fy-2021/#ref13">$814 million dollars</a> to encourage and assist with integration into life in the U.S., paricularly for refugees and other foreign-born individuals seeking "shelter or aid from disasters, oppression, emergency medical issues and other urgent circumstances" (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian">USCIS</a>). Despite the fact that refugee admission ceilings have been at their <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/us-annual-refugee-resettlement-ceilings-and-number-refugees-admitted-united">lowest in history</a> under the Trump administration, as a country, we still spend a large amount of money and effort in this arena. An interest in the wellbeing of refugees is not only consistent with America's values, but also reflects my heart for refugee, immigrant, and marginalized communities.

_2. How might characteristics of refugee arrivals and the communities in which they live influence how well they adjust to life in the U.S.?_  
The melting pot metaphor has often been used to describe the social and economic integration of European voluntary immigrants to the U.S. in the early 20th century. But how relevant is this imagery for newcomers from Asia, Latin America, and Africa who are likely to face a different set of challenges? Here, I concentrate on _Somali_ refugees for a few reasons. First, the history of slavery and ongoing marginalization of people racialized as "Black" in the U.S. are two realities likely to create additional challenges to social integration for African refugees that European immigrants in the early 20th century did not have to face in the same way. Second, anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown and been emboldened by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks are more likely to effect the interpersonal experiences of Somali refugees who are largely Muslim. Overall, Somali refugees are more likely to racially, religiously, culturally, and linguistically differ from the people in the communities where they settle. 

### Project Goals
This shiny app will answer these initial questions. More than that though, I hope to pique your interest in issues related to refugee resettlement, immigration, and community-building that leave you wondering how these processes that we often take for granted actually work. And I hope to leave you wondering how we can improve on them. Enjoy!

### Data Sources
<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">ACS 5-year 2009 and 2019 data</a>    
<a href="https://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals/">Refugee Processing Center Admissions Data</a>    
<a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/">FBI Crime Data</a>    

### Key Findings (and Consequent Questions)
When comparing major initial resettlement locations to secondary migration locations on a handful of characteristics (racial composition, unemployment rate, immigrant and African population, and crime rate), we see that there are some interesting differences that spur additional questions:

1: **Differences in Racial Composition**

Atlanta, GA (DeKalb County), an initial resettlement location, has a higher proportion of people who racially identify as Black than any of the secondary migration locations listed. Qualitative and quantitative research findings and analyses from other sources show an outflow of Somali refugees from Atlanta, GA to cities with higher proportions of people who racially identify as White (e.g., Minneapolis in Hennepin County, MN and Lewiston in Androscoggin County, ME). Does race meaningfully impact the ways in which resettled Somali refugees socially and economically integrate in a community? If so, how?

2: **Differences in State Crime Rates**

Qualitative studies have shown that some Somali refugees have moved to Lewiston, ME (Androscoggin County) from Clarkston, GA (DeKalb County) because it is safer. When comparing incidences of crime in Maine and Georgia, this appears to be the case in every area except reports of rape. Whether looking at 2009 or 2019 data, Maine reports higher occurrences of this specific indicator of crime and safety. Are the differences we observe here statistically significant? And might perceptions of safety differ based on an individual's gender or family composition? Would additional county or city-level crime data paint a different picture?

3: **St. Cloud, MN as a Desired Location**

Population migration data show resettled Somali refugees moving from larger cities like Dallas, TX (Dallas County) and Seattle, WA (King County) to St. Cloud, MN (Stearns County). Given that Minneapolis is categorized as a more established gateway city for immigrants and refugees, what could be driving Somalis to St. Cloud? Compared to Dallas and Seattle, St. Cloud was less racially diverse, had higher unemployment rates for people racialized as Black, but a higher proportion of foreign born Africans within it's immigrant population in 2019. What other community and state-level factors could play a role in this observed trend?

### Final Thoughts & Future Directions
Valuable research is being done on algorithms that can be used to resettle refugees in locations that are more likely to lead to faster economic integration. What other community characteristics matter as resettled refugees pursue integration and belonging in a new country? The preliminary analyses explored in this app address and spark questions that move us toward a larger line of inquiry: _are the differences in locations meaningfully different in ways that influence resettled refugees' decisions to move in pursuit of economic opportunity, social integration, and belonging?_ The types of questions prompted by the quick comparisons here should be addressed in order to holistically improve the effectiveness of refugee resettlement processes for individuals and communities alike.

Additional research in this area can be both more in-depth (focusing on Somali refugees in particular and the different ethnic groups within this community), and more broad (exploring how navigating resettlement differs for refugees from other countries of origin). Moreover, energy should also be dedicated to people within resettlement communities, the other side of the resettlement relationship. For cities and towns concerned about newcomers leaving, what (if anything) can be done to better help them retain refugee and immigrant populations? For places that are unhappy about the influxes of newcomers that they are receiving, what (if anything) can be done to address their concerns? Overall, the integration process is a group effort. My hope is that our research, policies, and efforts operate with this reality in mind.
